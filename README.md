# Overview

This code intends to help me learn how to make a basic game using python.

Dog Dodger is a game inspired on the Google Dinosaur game. The goal is to jump over dogs trying to catch you while you make points by surviving the challenge the longest.
Moving instructions:
Jump -> Spacebar
Forward -> right key
Backward -> left key

The purpose of this code is to have my first experience making games.

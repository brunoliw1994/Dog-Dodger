# Overview

The intent of this code is to learn how to make a basic game using python.

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
Dog Dodger is a game inspired on the Google Dinosaur game. The goal is to jump over dogs that are trying to catch you while you make points by surviving the challenge the longest.
Moving instructions:
Jump -> Spacebar
Forward -> right key
Backward -> left key

The purpose of this code is to have my first experience making games.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
